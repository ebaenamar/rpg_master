# Medieval Chronicles: The Fallen Knight

A text-based, historically grounded roleplaying game (RPG) powered by AI21's language models. This agentic system features dynamic storytelling, historical context via RAG, moral decision-making, and an interactive LLM-driven NPC companion. Now available as a Jupyter Notebook for an enhanced interactive experience!

## üîÆ Game Concept

This RPG is inspired by systems like Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Dungeons & Dragons. The player engages in an interactive story where they control one human character, while a second companion character (Ser Elyen) is controlled by a Language Model (LLM). The game is structured as a sequence of scenes, each offering four dynamically generated choices that lead to different moral, narrative, and relationship consequences.

The world is grounded in real medieval history, retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides historical context to the LLM agent and game logic.

## üß± System Architecture

The system is composed of five main components:

1. **Game Orchestrator**: The central controller that manages game flow, scene logic, and player choices.
2. **RAG Retriever**: Provides real-world historical context to ground the experience in accurate medieval facts.
3. **Scoring Engine**: Tracks player alignment, relationship with the LLM agent, and other stats.
4. **Behavior Controller**: Manages the LLM agent's personality and responses based on game state.
5. **LLM Character Agent**: The AI-controlled companion character that responds to player actions.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- AI21 API key
- Jupyter Notebook (for notebook version)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your AI21 API key:

```
AI21_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Jupyter Notebook Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv rpg_venv
source rpg_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: rpg_venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter ipywidgets
```

3. Register the virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=rpg_venv --display-name="RPG Game Environment"
```

4. Set your AI21 API key in the environment:

```bash
export AI21_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # On Windows: set AI21_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook rpg_game_demo.ipynb
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Standard Version

Run the game with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter your character name and make choices throughout the story.

### Jupyter Notebook Version

1. Open the `rpg_game_demo.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
2. Make sure to select the "RPG Game Environment" kernel
3. Run the cells in order to set up the environment and start the game
4. Interact with the game using the buttons generated in the notebook

## üß† Game Features

- **Dynamic Storytelling**: Each scene offers four choices with different consequences
- **Historical Accuracy**: RAG system provides real medieval context
- **Character Development**: Your alignment evolves based on choices
- **Relationship System**: Build trust with your AI companion
- **Moral Consequences**: Actions affect your Law-Chaos and Good-Evil alignment
- **Interactive Notebook**: Play the game in an interactive Jupyter environment (notebook version)

## üìö Game Data

The game data is stored in JSON format in the `data` directory:

- `game_data.json`: Contains scene descriptions, actions, and consequences
- `historical_data.json`: Historical facts for the RAG system
- `save_game.json`: Created when you save your game progress

## üîß Customization

You can customize the game by:

1. Editing `game_data.json` to add new scenes and storylines
2. Adding more historical facts to `historical_data.json`
3. Modifying the scoring effects in `game_data.json` to change how actions impact alignment
4. Fine-tuning the LLM prompts in `notebook_helper.py` or `agent_helper.py`
